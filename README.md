## Overview <a id="1"></a>
This was my first Kaggle competition, and also my very first ML project. I did not have the knowledge of the tools I need, nor did I know how to even approach the problem, but I wanted to jump into the data right away. My goal here, for this project, was to learn how to use python tools to build ML models that can solve problems like this: predict house prices based on a bunch of collected housing parameters.

In order to achieve my goal, the quickest way, I thought, was to study the public notebooks that people shared on Kaggle. I listed all the notebooks I used in the end.

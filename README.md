## Overview <a id="1"></a>
This was my first Kaggle competition, and also my very first ML project. I did not have the knowledge of the tools I need, nor did I know how to even approach the problem, but I wanted to jump into the data right away. My goal here, for this project, was to learn how to use python tools to build ML models that can solve regression problems like this: predict house prices based on a bunch of collected housing parameters.

In order to achieve my goal, the quickest way, I thought, was to study the public notebooks that people shared on Kaggle. I picked out three notebooks (which I listed towards the end) and read every line of codes. From doing that, I learned how to do exploratory data analysis (EDA) using `pandas`, `numpy` and `sesaborn`, how to do feature selection and feature engineering, and how to build traditional ML models using `scikit-learn`.

After trying out a few different models, `XGBoost` gave me the best outcome. I eventually [scored at top 9%](https://www.kaggle.com/zhangyang2020/competitions). This was no where near perfect, but I decided it was good enough for me at the moment and it was time to move on to the next project.

  - EDA using seaborn and matplotlib
  - feature selection (drop redundant features and feature engineering) base on EDA
  - data scaling
  - model selection and model training
  - model varification
  - prediction
